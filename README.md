# Cpp-Hangman-Game
This was one of my first C++ project i've ever made, i still had a lot to learn from it so i was slowly getting use to foundamentals.
This is a really simple Hangman game where when the program starts, a random string from an array gets chosen and the user has to guess it.
At the end of the program there'll be shown the total of inputs insert and the amount of errors. Every 4 errors, the word gets resetted.
This is my first repository so i hope you like it. Thank you!
